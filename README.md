# Cost_and_CO2_emission_heatmap_hydrolysis

A heatmap is a visual representation that uses colors to show the strength of a relationship between variables in a data matrix. It is important for evaluating correlations between project variables, allowing you to quickly identify associations between different parameters. This helps designers and researchers understand how design variables interact with each other, facilitating informed decision-making and design optimization.

The purpose of this project is to construct a heatmap that identifies the intensities of correlations between the variables involved in a triolein hydrolysis process in oleic acid.
